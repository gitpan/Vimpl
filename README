Vimpl

Vimpl is meant to be a simple script to manage Vim plugins with Git and
Pathogen.vim.  Plugins are scraped from the excellent http://vim-scripts.org
list of mirrors and installed as git submodules in $HOME/.vim/bundle/

USAGE

Commands:
	init - Initializes a git repo in your $HOME/.vim folder and installs Pathogen.vim
		as a git submodule.

	restore <gitrepo> - Clones the provided git repository into $HOME/.vim
		Initializes all git submodules and updates all submodules.

	search <vim plugins>... - Provides a list of matching plugins found on vim-scripts.org

		for the $HOME/.vim repo , git submodules or both.  If not specified, plugins only.

	update - Updates the local list of plugin mirrors from vim-scripts.org.

	backup - If the $HOME/.vim repo already has a remote origin,
		'backup' will push to it.

		backup github <name> [public|private] - Vimpl will attempt to create a repo for you
			on GitHub <name> using credentials in your $HOME/.gitconfig .  Vimpl will then push your
